**Mission and Vision**  
The laboratory was established in October 2000 and is affiliated with the National Engineering Research Center for Light Alloy Net Forming, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The goal of this laboratory is to cultivate creative and artistic talents through teaching, scientific research, and innovation, so that they can work wisely, creatively and effectively for the well-being of mankind; to develop fundamenttal technologies, and advanced applied technologies; and to pioneer new industries, purusing the mission to serve the nation and the world, creating a better world.

The research fields of this laboratory mainly include: plasma chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), ion beam etching, nanoporous functional polymer film, gas-induced color film, applied electrochemistry, surface modification and coating Layer technology and corrosion and protection fields. Since the establishment of the laboratory, it has undertaken Shanghai Key Scientific and Technological Research Project, Shanghai Key Basic Research Project, National Security 973 Sub-Project, National Natural Science Fund Sub-Project, National Natural Science Fund Project, Aerospace Support Fund Project, and School National Defense Fund Project, COMAC Innovation Fund Project, Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Laboratory Fund Project and many other national vertical basic scientific research projects, as well as many other horizontal scientific research projects with the Boeing Company, the General Motors Company, Hitachi, Ltd., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd., Alif (Shenzhen) Electronics Co., Ltd. etc.; the tasks and requirements of various scientific research projects have all been successfully completed.

By completing the research tasks of various scientific research projects, the laboratory has obtained 10 authorized invention patents in China; 8 national, provincial and ministerial awards; 4 transferable technological achievements with independent intellectual property rights: (1) High surface area of magnesium alloy products Conductive high corrosion resistance film preparation technology; (2) High-performance corrosion-resistant "Concord Coating" technology on the surface of magnesium alloy products; (3) Fast hard anodizing technology of aluminum alloy; (4) High infrared emissivity and high conductivity heat Control coating technology. These technologies and achievements have been practically applied to products such as missile warheads, radar antennas, optical transmitters, and fuel cell cylinders.
