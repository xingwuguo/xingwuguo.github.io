**Mission and Vision**  
The laboratory was established in October 2000 and is affiliated to the National Engineering Research Center for Light Alloy Net Forming, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University. The goal of this laboratory is to cultivate creative and artistic talents through teaching, scientific research and innovation, so that they can work wisely, creatively and effectively for the well-being of mankind; develop basic technologies and advanced application technologies. Innovating industries, pursuing the mission of serving the country and the world, and creating a better world.

The research fields of this laboratory mainly include: plasma chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), ion beam etching, nanoporous functional polymer film, gas-induced color film, applied electrochemistry, surface modification and coating Layer technology and corrosion and protection fields. Since the establishment of the laboratory, it has undertaken key scientific and technological research projects in Shanghai, key basic research projects in Shanghai, national security 973 sub-projects, national natural science fund sub-projects, national natural science fund projects, aerospace support fund projects, and school defense funds , COMAC Innovation Fund, the Eighth Aerospace Academy-Shanghai Jiaotong University Joint Laboratory Fund and many other national vertical basic scientific research projects, as well as The Boeing Company, General Motors Company, Hitachi Hitachi, Ltd., Huawei Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd., Alif (Shenzhen) Electronics Co., Ltd. and many other horizontal scientific research projects have successfully completed the tasks and requirements of various scientific research projects.

By completing the research tasks of various scientific research projects, the laboratory has obtained 10 authorized invention patents in China; 8 national, provincial and ministerial awards; 4 transferable technological achievements with independent intellectual property rights: (1) High surface area of magnesium alloy products Conductive high corrosion resistance film preparation technology; (2) High-performance corrosion-resistant "Concord Coating" technology on the surface of magnesium alloy products; (3) Fast hard anodizing technology of aluminum alloy; (4) High infrared emissivity and high conductivity heat Control coating technology. These technologies and achievements have been practically applied to products such as missile warheads, radar antennas, optical transmitters, and fuel cell cylinders.
