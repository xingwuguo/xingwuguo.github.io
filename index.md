# Welcome to xingwuguo's Pages

Today is August 7, 2021. Just begin to lear how to use Github. I'v made a big progress today. Github is a useful tool. I'm very happy about it.


## Research Aears

Current main research areas: 

1) Nanoporous gasochromic films from Block Copolymer Precursors

2) Functional polymer films fabricated by Plasma polymerization

3) Microporous polymer film prepared by 3D printing methods and ion beam etching

4) Surface modification and coating technology for light metals (such as Al, Mg, Ti)
